# K-Means-Clustering
This is my data-analytics (CS40003) course project. In this project I have Implemented K-Means-Clustering, performed Elbow method analysis and Silhouette analysis from scratch without using libraries (like scikit-learn
) although some very basic libraries pandas, numpy and matplotlib are used for data manipulation and visualization. As given data is labeled I also checked clustering quality by calculating F1-Score, precission and Recall.
All results obtained were impressive.
